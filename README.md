# Restaurant-Feedback-Analysis

## **Description:**
In this project, you will dive deep into the world of restaurant reviews.First, we select a restaurant of our choice from the OpenTable website, this restaurant should have over 1500 reviews, then using Selenium and BeautifulSoup we scrape all the reviews.You’ll extract key information like the restaurant name, review content, ratings, and dates, saving it in a neat and structured format.Next, you’ll use prompt engineering to categorize reviews into food and staff-related feedback, ensuring accuracy and privacy by excluding personal data.Then, get ready to build a cool GUI with Flask, It will allow users to search reviews, highlight food and staff comments in different colors, and make the experience super interactive. Finally, compare your restaurant’s ratings over time with any desired competitor’s through visualizations. Track rating trends, and present a clear comparison with interactive graphs and prompt engineering. The goal is to create an engaging platform where users can easily explore, analyze, and compare restaurant reviews.

## **Technologies Used:**

**1- Programming Language:** Python

**2- Web Scraping:** Selenium, BeautifulSoup

**3- Data Processing:** Pandas, Prompt Engineering

**4- File Handling:** CSV, JSON

**5- Visualization:** Matplotlib

**6- GUI Framework:** Flask

## **Features:**

**1- Web Scraping:** Collect over 1500 reviews from OpenTable using Selenium and BeautifulSoup for selected restaurant and competitor restaurant.

**2- Prompt Engineering:** Sort reviews into food-related and staff-related categories using prompt engineering, provide a summary of the comparison between selected restaurant and competitor restaurant.

**3- Interactive GUI Dashboard:** Built with Flask to allow users to:
- Browse reviews.
- Highlight food and staff-related comments.
- Insert the link of any restaurant for comparison.

**4- Visualization:**
Compare your restaurant’s ratings with competitors.
Track rating trends over time using interactive graphs.

## **Usage:**

**Step 1:** Extract the folder.

**Step 2:** Open this folder in any desired IDE.

**Step 3:** Open Restaurant Feedback Analysis Notebook, select your python kernel then run each cell, except for the last one.

**Step 4:** Open the app python file and run it, the dashboard will open, you can press the browse comments button to display all food and staff related comments.You will also be given a form below,in this form you can insert the link of any restaurant from the OpenTable website for comparison.

**Step 5:** Navigate back to the Restaurant Feedback Analysis Notebook and run the last cell for generating summary of the comparison between the 2 restaurants.

## **Future Improvements:**

**1- Efficient Scraping:** Currently user needs to close the browser manually once the scraping is finished, moreover if some error occurs during scraping due to network issues, user needs to refresh the page manually.

**2- Filtering Options:** Users should be able to filter data based on keywords, ratings, range of dates.
