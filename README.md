# Restaurant-Feedback-Analysis

## **Description:**
In this project, you will dive deep into the world of restaurant reviews.First, we select a restaurant of our choice from the OpenTable website, this restaurant should have over 1500 reviews, then using Selenium and BeautifulSoup we scrape all the reviews.You’ll extract key information like the restaurant name, review content, ratings, and dates, saving it in a neat and structured format.Next, you’ll use prompt engineering to categorize reviews into food and staff-related feedback, ensuring accuracy and privacy by excluding personal data.Then, get ready to build a cool GUI with Flask, It will allow users to search reviews, highlight food and staff comments in different colors, and make the experience super interactive. Finally, compare your restaurant’s ratings over time with any desired competitor’s through visualizations. Track rating trends, and present a clear comparison with interactive graphs and prompt engineering. The goal is to create an engaging platform where users can easily explore, analyze, and compare restaurant reviews.

## **Features:**

**Web Scraping:** Collect over 1500 reviews from OpenTable using Selenium and BeautifulSoup for selected restaurant and competitor restaurant.
